# ðŸŒŸ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŒŸ

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in modern PHP.<br>
All code is written without any assistance by a LLM (where would be the fun then, right?).

I don't try to write the most efficient code, but the most readable so that someone can read and understand it quickly.

## Prequesites

- PHP 8.3+
- Composer

## Run

```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/marco-kretz/advent-of-code-2024.git
$ cd advent-of-code-2024
$ composer install
$ php bin/solve day1
```

## Perfomance

To simplify things I just measure the whole day's solution in one (Part One + Two).

| Day | Time   | Memory (peak) |
| --- | ------ | ------------- |
| 1   | 0.007s | 1.84mb        |
| 2   | 0.008s | 1.98mb        |
| 3   | 0.007s | 1.81mb        |
| 4   | 0.016s | 6.07mb        |
| 5   | 0.003s | 2.19mb        |
| 6   | 2.623s | 4.44mb        |
