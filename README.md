# ðŸŒŸ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŒŸ

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in modern PHP.<br>
All code is written without any assistance by a LLM (where would be the fun then, right?).

I don't try to write the most efficient code, but the most readable so that someone can read and understand it quickly.

## Prequesites

-   PHP 8.3+
-   Composer

## Run

```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/marco-kretz/advent-of-code-2024.git
$ cd advent-of-code-2024
$ composer install
$ php bin/solve day1
```
